def times(a, b): # function header.
    return a * b
# a function object is created by the above def statement and assigned to the name times
r = times(5, 4) # function call
print(r)
r = times('spam', 4)
print(r) # spamspamspamspam

# our function works with more string and number objects for argument a. this allows it do perform repetition on strings and multiplication on numbers
# this is a key idea to using python well and is called polymorphism.

multiplier = times # you can assign new names that reference the name function object
r = multiplier(3, 8)
print(r)
