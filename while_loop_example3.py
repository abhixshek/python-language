# The if, elif, and else parts in the preceding example are associated as part of the same
# statement because they all line up vertically (i.e., share the same level of indentation).
# The if statement spans from the word if to the start of the print statement on the last
# line of the script. In turn, the entire if block is part of the while loop because all of it
# is indented under the loopâ€™s header line.
